# JavaScript Null Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in JavaScript involving null values and provides a solution for improved error handling.

The `bug.js` file shows a basic function that handles null values by returning null. While functional, it lacks more informative error handling that may be desired in production environments.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a more robust solution using try-catch blocks or alternative default values for enhanced error handling and user experience.
